# United-States-Guessing-Game-

This game tests the user's knowledge of all 50 states in the US. I used the Turtle library to create an interactive map of the United States using an img file. I then made a marker in Turtle that writes the names of each state that the user guesses. In order to write the names of each state on the correct part of the map, I used the Pandas library to read a csv value that has the x and y coordinates of every state on the map.  So when the user guesses a state correctly, the marker would go to the applicable state's coordinates and print the name out.  Finally, if the user couldn't guess all 50 states, I used Pandas to create a csv file with a list of all the states that were not guessed.  This way the user has a reference of what states they still need to study.  The game can also be ended early if the user types 'exit' in the dialog box.
